# Introduction
piCore is the Raspberry Pi port of Tiny Core Linux, which is an independent system architected by Robert Shingledecker and now developed by a small team of developers with strong community support.

Tiny Core Linux is not a traditional distribution but a toolkit to create your own customized system. It offers not only flexibility, small footprint but a very recent kernel and set of applications making
it ideal for custom system, appliances as well as to learn Linux specially on the Raspberry Pi.

## Concept
piCore is running entirely in RAM. Boot media is not used after boot and there is no installation in conventional terms.

Default operational mode is Cloud (Internet) Mode. Extensions (applications) are downloaded from the repository via Internet. File system is in RAM, extensions are mounted to the file system read-only.
Changes are not saved over reboots, you get always the same clean system after boot.

For details on concept read http://tinycorelinux.net/concepts.html

# Installation
piCore is distributed in a .zip archive containing raw SD card image which can be installed with dd command on Linux or Win32 Disk Imager on Windows. After successfully copying image to SD card it is ready to boot in Raspberry Pi. While it works offline, advised to have a wired Internet connections to have proper system time, to install packages or for remote SSH access for headless systems.

# After the first run
Execute 'filetool.sh -b' shell command after the first boot to save generated unique SSH keys which will be used during next boots. It will speed up boot and eliminate to bother new keys in SSH client.

# SD card partitioning
First partition, mmcblk0p1 is VFAT type; it contains the basic piCore system and the Raspberry Pi boot loader, firmware and other support files. Partition is unmounted during operation, system is not using it after boot and never writes.

Second partition, mmcblk0p2 is a Linux ext4 partion which contains preinstalled extensions, openssh and mc (Midnight Commander) and configuration files. It is a small partion with no free space, you must expand its size to have enough room for additional extensions, updates and  backups. It can be done on the running system locally or remote via SSH following these steps:
1. Start fdisk partitioning tool as root:
```
sudo fdisk -u /dev/mmcblk0
```
> Now list partitions with 'p' command and write down the starting and ending sectors of the second partition.

2. Delete second partition with 'd' than recreate it with 'n' command. Use the same starting sector as deleted had and provide end sector or size greater than deleted had having enough free space for Mounted Mode. When finished, exit fdisk with 'w' command. Now partition size increased but file system size is not yet changed.
3. Reboot piCore. It is necessary to make Kernel aware of changes.
4. After reboot expand file system to the new partition boundaries with typing the following command as root:
```
resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
```
> Now you are ready to use the bigger partition.

<!--- ## Optional - Swap
By default piCore has a gzip compressed swap in RAM, automatically sized to 25% of available RAM. This can be disabled with the NOZSWAP boot code.

Create a swap partition with fdisk if you need more swap or not using ZSWAP (do not forget to format with mkswap command). Size depends on applications you are running, compilation of large programs may require more than 1 Gbyte swap, while for everyday use 512k may be enough.
While swap file can be used, we encourage use of swap partition for performance.

Note: You can use other tools, e.g. gparted on third-party Linux systems to make necessary changes.

<!---## Optional - Boot codes
Additionally to the common Linux boot codes there are many Tiny Core Linux (piCore) specific options. See http://tinycorelinux.net/faq.html#bootcodes for list. Boot codes are specified in the /mnt/mmcblk0p1/cmdline.txt file.

# Login, passwords
Default user is tc. There are no user passwords, tc user is auto logged in on the terminal. In case of piCore-x.y password for tc user is

piCore

It is not possible to log in as root.

# Support
piCore is community supported. Use the Raspberry Pi section of the Tiny Core Linux Forums:
http://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php/board,57.0.html
You can find many useful information in other sections also, related to Tiny Core Linux operation and use in general. 

## Core Book
Also, strongly advised to read the Core book, "Into the Core":
http://tinycorelinux.net/book.html
It is about the x86 version in details, but generic parts, like concept, tools, etc. valid for other ports, like piCore.

Enjoy!
